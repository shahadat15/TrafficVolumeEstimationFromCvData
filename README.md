# TrafficVolumeEstimationFromCvData

Traffic Simulation data is generated from a tool called TCA. This code edit the input of TCA, call the TCA program and finally post process the TCA output. 
A monte carlo simulation is performed using this code. The final results are the volume at user defined locations.
